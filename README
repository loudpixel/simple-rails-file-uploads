== Basics

This simple application shows you how to create a simple upload form that stores uploaded files to the filesystem and organizes the files by date (created at date). The application will create a directory in the format of /YYYY/MM/DD/ within the directory specified by STORAGE_DIR. 

If your files need to be accessible to the web, consider changing STORAGE_DIR to /public/uploaded_files/.

== Configuration

app/models/uploaded_file.rb
- STORAGE_DIR Modify this value to instruct the app to store the files at a different location (default is "doc/uploaded_files/", a non web accessible directory)
